                eventually it materialized
                in 2019. His family

                inception was originally
                planned for 2018, Gagan felt
                compelled to pursue a
                deeper understanding of
                design by immersing himself
                in the world of interior
                architecture after completing
                his schooling. However, a
                year later, his unwavering

                prestigious institution in
                Chandigarh, Gagan wasted no

                experience. He joined a
                residential-focused firm as a

                challenges such as inadequate
                compensation and delayed
